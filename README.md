# Matcha Matches:
A website full of mini-games and twists added to said mini-games! Built on react for the frontend and django for the backend. 

## Tic-Tac-Tea:
Tic-Tac-Tea is inspired by the ultimate Tic Tac Toe game. In this game, there's a traditional 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board but in each of the 9 fields there's another Tic Tac Toe board. The players will take turns placing their corresponding figure, either X or O. Addinally, the field placements of the players will influence which field the next player must play on.
