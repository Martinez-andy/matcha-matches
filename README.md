# Matcha Matches:
Matcha matches is a web application that contains tic-tac-toe, four in a row, and checkers. 
In addtion to these traditional games, we have also implemented "twisted" versions.
The rules and descriptions for these "twisted" versions are below. 
To toggle between the two versions, click on the "brew" switch on the top right of the website. 
Doing so will alter the links such that they redirect to their alternate counterparts. 
Each of these games are local two-player games, although an introduction of 
a multi-player option is on its way. Please try them out and more importantly, have fun!

## Tic-Tac-Tea:
Tic-Tac-Tea is inspired by the ultimate Tic Tac Toe game. In this game, there's a traditional 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board but in each of the 9 fields there's another Tic Tac Toe board. Additionally, the field placements of the players will influence which field the next player must play on. The objective of the players should be to win the Tic-Tac-Tea game in the fields in order to get an X or O on the board. In case of a tie, the players must play again in that field and try to redeem themselves.
To win the ultimate game, the player must get 3 of their corresponding figure, either X or O, in a row on the board. 

## Coco Connect:
In Coco Connect, the players will have the opportunity to choose between red or yellow discs to use for the game. After both players have claimed a color, they will take turns selecting and placing their disc on an unoccupied column space on the Coco Connect grid. Once the disc has been placed, the player will proceed to spin the column they have chosen. A player wins only when they have placed 4 discs in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagnolly. 

## Checkers Chai:
Bringing checkers to another level, Checkers Chai is composed of ONLY royal pieces. Normally, checker pieces that are not royal can only move diagnolly forward on the dark squares. In Checkers Chai, the players can move the checker pieces both forward and backwards on the dark sqaures since the pieces are royal.
