# Matcha Matches:
Matcha matches is a web application that contains tic-tac-toe, four in a row, and checkers. 
In addtion to these traditional games, we have also implemented "twisted" versions.
The rules and descriptions for these "twisted" versions are below. 
To toggle between the two versions, click on the "brew" switch on the top right of the website. 
Doing so will alter the links such that they redirect to their alternate counterparts. 
Each of these games are local two-player games, although an introduction of 
a multi-player option is on its way. Please try them out and more importantly, have fun!
